# Content Creation Tool Project Summary

## Project Overview
The Content Creation Tool (CCT) is a Next.js application designed to create, manage, and export modular content packs for text-based adventure games. It focuses on procedural generation, allowing a small amount of authored content to create virtually unlimited unique player experiences.

## Core Principles
1. **Procedurality**: All content is designed for maximum procedural variation
2. **Modularity**: Content is organized in discrete, combinable packs
3. **Extensibility**: The system can be expanded to support new content types
4. **Usability**: Accessible for both technical and non-technical content creators
5. **Portability**: Content packs can be exported in standard formats
6. **Collaboration**: Support for team-based content development
7. **Open Standards**: Well-documented formats for community extension

## Key Components
1. **Template Editor**: GUI for creating and editing procedural content templates
2. **Procedural Generator**: Previews and tests variations of templates
3. **Content Simulator**: Tests content with the D20 system in simulated gameplay
4. **Content Database**: Local storage for all templates and assets
5. **Export Manager**: Packages content for use in games

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

```

## Development Approach
The project emphasizes:
- **Modularity**: Components and features are designed to be independent and reusable
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing at all levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- **Documentation**: User guides for each feature, kept updated as features evolve
- **Accessibility**: Following WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Performance**: Optimized for both frontend and procedural generation

## Development Phases
The project is divided into 7 phases:

1. **Project Setup and Core Infrastructure** (2-3 weeks)
2. **Template Editor Development** (3-4 weeks)
3. **Procedural Generator Development** (2-3 weeks)
4. **Content Simulator Development** (2-3 weeks)
5. **Content Database Development** (2-3 weeks)
6. **Export Manager Development** (1-2 weeks)
7. **Integration and Refinement** (2-3 weeks)

Total estimated development time: 14-20 weeks

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.1, React 19.0.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- **State Management**: React Context (for global state)
- **Data Storage**: Local storage/IndexedDB

## Documentation Strategy
- User guides in markdown format for each feature
- Documentation created alongside feature development
- Regular updates as features evolve
- Consistent structure following the established template
- Code documentation using JSDoc

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components and utilities
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing for procedural generation

## Next Steps
1. Set up the initial project structure
   - Create necessary directories
   - Set up configuration files
   - Initialize basic components
2. Configure testing framework
   - Install and configure Jest and React Testing Library
   - Set up test scripts and CI integration
3. Begin implementation of core functionality
   - Start with the Template Editor
   - Develop the procedural generation engine
   - Create the basic UI components

## Conclusion
The Content Creation Tool project is a comprehensive application for creating procedurally generated content for text-based adventure games. By following the established guidelines and development plan, we will create a modular, well-tested, and user-friendly tool that enables content creators to produce rich, varied game content with minimal effort.
