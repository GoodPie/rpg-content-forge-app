# RPG Content Forge Requirements Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for the RPG Content Forge (CCT) based on the design document. The CCT is a standalone application designed to create, manage, and export modular content packs for text-based adventure games with a focus on procedural generation.

## Core Principles
1. **Procedurality**: All content is designed for maximum procedural variation
2. **Modularity**: Content is organized in discrete, combinable packs
3. **Extensibility**: The system can be expanded to support new content types
4. **Usability**: Accessible for both technical and non-technical content creators
5. **Portability**: Content packs can be exported in standard formats
6. **Collaboration**: Support for team-based content development
7. **Open Standards**: Well-documented formats for community extension

## Key Components

### 1. Template Editor
- GUI for creating and editing procedural content templates
- Form-based editing for template properties
- Text editor with syntax highlighting for variables and conditions
- Visual branching diagram for choices/outcomes
- Procedural preview pane showing multiple variations

### 2. Procedural Generator
- Previews and tests variations of templates
- Text Variation Viewer to see dozens of variations of text elements
- Structural Variation Analyzer to visualize different narrative paths
- Conditional Logic Tester to test how variables affect content
- Seed Explorer to generate variations with different seeds

### 3. Content Simulator
- Tests content with the D20 system in simulated gameplay
- Simulation controls for testing different scenarios
- Character sheet, inventory, and journal interfaces
- Options to regenerate text, try new seeds, and explore new paths

### 4. Content Database
- Local storage for all templates and assets
- Organization of content into packs and hierarchies
- Support for metadata, dependencies, and procedural parameters

### 5. Export Manager
- Packages content for use in games
- Multiple export formats (JSON, SQLite, Binary)
- Export process with validation and optimization options

## Procedural Content Structure
The system supports various template types:
1. **Encounters**: Interactive scenarios with text, options, and outcomes
2. **Locations**: Places with descriptions, points of interest, and encounters
3. **NPCs**: Characters with procedural names, appearances, personalities, and dialogue
4. **Items**: Objects with procedural properties and variations
5. **Quests**: Multi-step objectives with procedural elements

Each template type has a specific structure with:
- Metadata (ID, type, tags)
- Procedural parameters
- Content with variable placeholders
- Variation rules and conditions

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, intuitive interface with a focus on content creation
- Hierarchical content tree for organization
- Specialized editors for different content types
- Preview functionality for procedural variations
- Simulation interface for testing content
- Analysis tools for understanding procedural potential

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS styling
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Comprehensive testing at all levels
- Documentation for each feature
- Support for different export formats
- Performance optimization for procedural generation

## User Documentation Requirements
- User guides in markdown format for each feature
- Process for keeping documentation updated
- Tutorials for common workflows
- Reference documentation for template formats
- Best practices for procedural content creation
