# Content Creation Tool Design Document
## for Infinite Adventures: Procedural Generation Focus

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Content Creation Tool (CCT) is a standalone application designed to create, manage, and export modular content packs for text-based adventure games. It provides a comprehensive environment for developing procedurally generated encounters, locations, NPCs, items, and other game elements through a template-based approach. The tool emphasizes procedural generation at every level, allowing a small amount of authored content to create virtually unlimited unique player experiences.

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Procedurality**: All content is designed for maximum procedural variation
- **Modularity**: Content is organized in discrete, combinable packs
- **Extensibility**: The system can be expanded to support new content types
- **Usability**: Accessible for both technical and non-technical content creators
- **Portability**: Content packs can be exported in standard formats
- **Collaboration**: Support for team-based content development
- **Open Standards**: Well-documented formats for community extension

## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 High-Level Components

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Content Creation Tool          │
├─────────────┬──────────────┬────────────┤
│  Template   │  Procedural  │  Content   │
│   Editor    │  Generator   │  Simulator │
├─────────────┴──────────────┴────────────┤
│               Content DB                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Export Manager               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Component Descriptions

1. **Template Editor**: GUI for creating and editing procedural content templates
2. **Procedural Generator**: Previews and tests variations of templates
3. **Content Simulator**: Tests content with the D20 system in simulated gameplay
4. **Content DB**: Local storage for all templates and assets
5. **Export Manager**: Packages content for use in games

### 2.3 Procedural Data Flow

1. Creator defines template structure with variable elements
2. Procedural generator creates variations for testing
3. Content is stored in the local database with procedural parameters
4. Creator tests variations using the simulator with different seeds
5. Validated content is organized into procedural packs
6. Packs are exported in game-ready formats

---

## 3. PROCEDURAL CONTENT STRUCTURE

### 3.1 Procedural Generation Philosophy

The tool is built around a multi-layered procedural generation approach:

1. **Text Variation**: Different descriptions, dialogues, and narrative elements
2. **Structural Variation**: Dynamic encounter options and outcomes
3. **Content Selection**: Which templates appear when and where
4. **World Structure**: How locations connect and relate to each other
5. **Narrative Flow**: How quests and storylines develop based on choices

- **Effective Variation**: Meaningfully different variations (not just word swaps)
- **Perception-Unique Ratio**: How many variations feel truly different
- **Narrative Branch Factor**: How many significant path divergences exist
- **Context Sensitivity Score**: How responsive content is to player state

### 11.2 Creation Analytics

- Template procedural richness scoring
- Variation distribution analysis
- Repetition probability detection
- Content coverage visualization
- Variable usage tracking

### 11.3 Testing Analytics

- Seed comparison tools
- Path coverage visualization
- Parameter variation testing
- Conditional path analysis
- Generation performance metrics
