# React Synchronous Access Warning

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing a console error related to synchronous access to React context:

```
createConsoleError@http://localhost:3001/_next/static/chunks/node_modules_next_dist_client_8f19e6fb._.js:882:80
handleConsoleError@http://localhost:3001/_next/static/chunks/node_modules_next_dist_client_8f19e6fb._.js:1058:54

ClientPageRoot@http://localhost:3001/_next/static/chunks/node_modules_next_dist_1a6ee436._.js:2061:50
```

## Root Cause

The error was occurring in the `VariableLibraryPage` component. After investigation, we found that the component had an unused state variable `selectedVariable` that was initialized but never used:

```jsx
const [selectedVariable, setSelectedVariable] = useState<Variable | null>(null);
```

This unused state was likely causing React to perform a synchronous access to its context, triggering the warning.

## Solution

The solution was to remove the unused state variable from the component:

1. Removed the `useState` import since it was no longer needed
2. Removed the `Variable` type import since it was no longer needed
3. Removed the `selectedVariable` state declaration and initialization

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Avoid unused state variables**: Only declare state variables that are actually used in the component.
2. **Clean up unused imports**: Remove imports that are no longer needed to keep the code clean.
3. **Use linting rules**: Configure ESLint with rules like `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` and `no-unused-vars` to catch these issues early.
4. **Code reviews**: Pay attention to unused variables and imports during code reviews.
